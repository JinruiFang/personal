abstract: 
- Introduction. Medication shortages continue to pose significant challenges within the US healthcare system. However, there is limited knowledge about the associations between sociodemographic factors and the likelihood of experiencing shortages with prescribed medications and over-the-counter medications. 

- Methods. This cross-sectional study used data from the US Census Household Pulse Survey (Augustâ€“October 2023), a nationally representative survey of adults aged 18 and above. Sociodemographic factors included age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, marital and employment status, educational attainment, household income, number of children, health insurance, depression and anxiety symptoms, disability status, and region. Weighted multivariable models estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the same models; individuals with missing health insurance coverage were excluded.

- Results. Among the weighted sample of 211,910,452 individuals, greater shortage experiences with prescribed and over-the-counter medications were associated with middle age (e.g., 45-64 years, OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.14-1.58), transgender/other gender identity (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.77-2.51), higher educational attainment (e.g., graduate degrees, OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.48-1.73), higher number of children (e.g., three or more children, OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.29-1.58), having depression (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.39-1.61) and anxiety symptoms (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.90-2.38), and being disabled (OR 2.21, 95% CI 2.06-2.36). Being employed (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76-0.93) and having a higher household income (e.g., $100,000-$149,999, OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76) were associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing shortages.

- Conclusions. Significant sociodemographic disparities exist in medication shortages among US adults, particularly affecting those with lower socioeconomic status, transgender identities, mental health issues, and disabilities. Targeted interventions, improved drug supply chains, and equitable drug coverage are essential to reduce health inequities and improve outcomes.
